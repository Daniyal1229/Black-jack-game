# Title: Developed a Blackjack Game in Python

# Body:

I recently developed a blackjack game in Python as a way to practice my Python fundamentals. The game is a simple command-line game that allows the user to play against the dealer. The user can choose to hit or stand, and the game ends when the user busts or reaches 21.

# I used the following Python fundamentals in the development of this project:

Object-oriented programming
Functions
Conditional statements
Loops
Random number generation
I am happy with the results of this project. I was able to practice my Python fundamentals and learn more about the blackjack game. I am also confident that this project would be a good addition to my portfolio.
